# Finance Content Summarisation
1. A fine tuned flan-t5 model tailored to summarise or give the context of finance content.
2. The required libraries and thier versions are mentioned in the notebook file and you can directly load the model by locally installing the peft-finance-checkpoint and the notebook, and changing the directory path according to you system
3. The model is trained on google colab.

Edit: the old configuration and notebook file has been replaced with new files. The latest code has been tested with different sentences for multishot inference, and the best performing one has been replaced with the older one and updated for training and testing the fine-tuned model.
